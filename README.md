# generator-react-native

## Installation

This generator uses Yeoman, please install it first.

```
npm install -g yo
```

This is not available on `npm` _yet_. So for now, clone the project down and inside the folder run.

```
npm link
```

You can then run the following commands.

## Commands

First, please create yourself a new React Native project with `react-native init MyApp && cd MyApp` before running any of the generator commands.

### `base`

Base will generate you a new project start point. It includes the following,
* Router (using `react-native-router-flux`)
* Launch screen
* Redux setup
* Redux store that is persisted and restored automatically
* Redux logger
* Environment configuration variables
* Sagas (to handle async tasks like HTTP requests)
* Initial setup for deep linking
* Handy `fetch` wrapper that will log what requests are being made
* Pattern to manage components
* Environment display, stops you running your app in development mode when building for release

Please note, follow the "Manual Notes" below after running this command. Hopefully in the future these can be automated.

```
yo react-native:base
```

### `component`

An easy way to scaffold stateless and stateful components.

```
yo react-native:component MyComponent
yo react-native:component MyComponent --stateful
```

### `reducer`

An easy way to scaffold a reducer. It creates the reducer itself an example way to keep organise your associated actions.

```
yo react-native:reducer MyReducer
```

## Manual Notes

### After `react-native:base`

Add the following to the `[ignore]` section in the `.flowconfig`.

```
